# OpenCV_ObjectDetection
In this repository, I share just fill codes I have been doing based on what I learn on many tutorials on the internet about image detection technics.
The goal here is learning all the ways I can find a standard on an image.
 When I have one feature detected, a lot of images in my scenario will possibly have the same feature. Thatâ€™s why if I wanna build a great standard I need more features than just one, like color, form, how many corners my object has and where they are.
